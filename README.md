# Array (Project)
This Repository contains Array program in Java, which contains programs of 1D & 2D Array, helpful for understanding the purpose, method & working of arrays in programs.

## Programs Description:
1. Program 1: To remove duplicate elements from an array of range [1, n].
2. Program 2: To divide the array into exactly n / 2 pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by k.
3. Program 3: Create a 2D array from input array satisfying the following conditions:
- The 2D array should contain only the elements of the input array.

- Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.

- The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.
4. Program 4: Print an array of all the integers that appears twice or more from an array of range [1, n].

## Features
- Remove Duplicate Elements: Some of these programs contain methods & techniques of removing duplicate elements from an array.
- Recursion: Few of the methods are made with the logic of recursion.
- Time Complexity: By using the method of recursion, compilation is made in least possible run-time.
- Efficient: Recursion reduces runtime complexity as well as it allows program to take smaller size in memory to store.
- Conversion of 1D to 2D Array: By using the logical techniques, conversion of 1D Array into 2D Array was made possible.
